# Weekly Call Runbook

The FOSS Responders weekly call was our primary means of synchronous communication across all sub-teams and participants. We held the call at 10:00am PST.

## Governing Principles and Commitments

We took notes collectively in a shared google doc. The following commitments were pinned to the top of the document.

### Facilitator Commitments:
* I will strive to make sure everyone is heard;
* I will pause the conversation regularly to leave room for audio-only participants;
* I will do my best to drive us toward actionable outcomes;

### Attendee Commitments:
* Mute when you’re not speaking and wait to be called on;
* Raise your hand on camera when you’d like to be called on;
* When speaking, ask only one question or make only one statement;
* Help take notes below;
* Be Kind;

### Proposed Guiding Principles:
* Many different kinds of support are needed;

* Fill the cracks in the support system;
