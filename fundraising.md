### Initial Outreach (6 Weeks Before The Event)
```
Hi {contact}. I hope this finds you well, and that you and yours are healthy.

I wanted to reach out to invite you to join us in an initiative that is being put together by several of us in the open source community.

We have been busy organizing an effort to support free and open source community members who have been impacted by conference and event cancellations due to COVID-19. There are a lot of folks from across the industry who are involved. You can see more at fossresponders.com

As part of this effort, on May 1st, we will be organizing a virtual funding event. We are looking for corporate consumers of open source software who can show up with funding. Even if running a FOSS Fund isn't in the cards this year, this virtual funding event would be a good opportunity to support the community and connect with other FOSS Funders. {confirmed lead partner} is showing up with $10,000. It would be great to have you join us in any capacity. Let me know if you'd like details.

Cheers!
-D

### Follow-up (2 Weeks Before The Event)
```
Hi {contact},
 
I wanted to follow up on this email with some additional information about the event we're putting together with the FOSS Responders working group. We hope you'll be able to participate.
 
On May 22nd at 10:00AM PST we'll be hosting a virtual event to spotlight organizations and projects that have asked for financial support to help offset COVID-19 related losses. We want to celebrate these projects, help bring visibility to their needs, and we will be allocating funds that have been donated to the FOSS Responders initiative.
 
1 - Will you join us at the event? You can see the details here.
 
2 - Does {your employer} have any capacity to make a $5k-$10k donation to the event in support of these projects? Supporting organizations so far include {list of confirmed partners}. We would love to add you to the list.
 
I'd be happy to provide more details about the kinds of requests for help that we're seeing and the funds raised so far.
 
Thanks!
-D
